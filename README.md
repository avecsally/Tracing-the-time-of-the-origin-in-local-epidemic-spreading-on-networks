# Tracing-the-time-of-the-origin-in-local-epidemic-spreading-on-networks

Origin identification of the earliest cases during the pandemic is crucial in containing the spread of the disease. The high infectiousness of the disease during its incubation period (no symptom yet) and underlying human interaction pattern make it difficult to capture the entire line of the spread. To find the possible hidden spreading period span, we utilized the SEITR (susceptible - exposed- infected - tested positive - recovered) model on networks where the relation between E state and T state can implicit model the hidden spreading mechanism. We calibrated the model with real local resurgence epidemic data. Through our study, we found that the hidden spreading period span of the possible earliest case of local resurgence could vary according to the people interaction networks. Our modeling results showed the average shortest path of the network affects the hidden spreading period span and is crucial for contact tracing the origin of local resurgence.
